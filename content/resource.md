# Resources

## Tools

### GFCC

Time domain gamma tone cepstral coefficient (GFCC) provided by Jun Qi, EE dep. Tsinghua Univ., China. Reference: "Auditory feature based on Gammatone filters for robust speech recognition", ISCAS 2013.

[Download GFCC v0.2](http://wangd.cslt.org/public/tools/zip/gfcc.v0.2.tgz)

### Online CNSC

This package contains Matlab code for online learning approach for convolutive non-negative sparse coding (OLCNSC). Refer to the following paper presented at Interspeech 2011: Dong Wang, Nicholas Evans, "Online Pattern Learning for Convolutive Non-negative Sparse Coding".

[Download Online CNSC](http://wangd.cslt.org/public/tools/zip/olcnsc.tar.gz)

### Micro-FST Composition Tool

Usually, we need to embed a small FST into a large FST to implement a nested LM. This has been used in the pair-word approach for infrequent word enhancement. Check the paper from Interspeech 2015 for details. This package contains a tool for FST embedding.

### vMF-SNE

vMF-SNE is a tool for spherical data embedding and visualization, based on t-SNE (http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) adapted to handle spherical data (l-2 normalized).

Refer to the following technical report (TRP) for more details: "VMF-SNE: Embedding for Spherical Data" by Mian Wang, Dong Wang.

## Data

### CCC data resource

CSLT holds a close collaboration with Chinese Corpus Consortium (CCC) to collect and publish databases in China. The aim of the CCC is to provide corpora for Chinese ASR, TTS, NLP, perception analysis, phonetics analysis, linguistic analysis, and other related tasks. The corpora can be speech- or text-based; read or spontaneous; wideband or narrowband; standard or dialectal Chinese; clean or with noise; or of any other kinds which are deemed helpful for the foresaid purposes.

### CNCeleb1

This data is a large-scale speaker recognition dataset collected 'in the wild'. The dataset contains more than 130,000 utterances from 1,000 Chinese celebrities, and covers 11 different genres in the real world. All the audio files are coded as single channel and sampled at 16kHz with 16-bit precision.

### Trivial events database

A free database involving 7 types of human trivial events: cough, laugh, "wei", "hmm", "tsk-tsk", "ahem", sniff. The data is collected using a recording Android App.

### Uyghur text database

CSLT collaborated with [XinJiang University](http://www.xju.edu.cn/) on a wide range of research including speech recognition, information retrieval, and text processing. We published a multitude of resources to boost research on Uyghur. The text data published here is used for Uyghur text classification tasks, which involves 500 health and non-health documents respectively. It was collected by Mahpirat from XJU when she visited CSLT from 2012-2013.
